# Challenges: Group-Project (Practicum100, School of Masters)

## Task Description                                                                                                           

As an introduction to GitHub merging and branching, we were to form groups of up to 4 students. We created a github repo called "Challenges" to share results to this and coming challenges. We used branches, so that everyone can work on their own challenge. Our first challenges:

#### 1.) You are only allowed to perform 2 operations, multiply a number by 2, or subtract a number by 1. Given a number x and a number y, find the minimum number of operations needed to go from x to y.

 ```
 def min_operations(x, y):
  Fill this in.

print(min_operations(6, 20))
 (((6 - 1) * 2) * 2) = 20 : 3 operations needed only
 ```




#### 2.) Given 3 sorted lists, find the intersection of those 3 lists.
```
def intersection(l1, l2, l3):
   Fill this in.
  
print(intersection([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6, 8], [3, 4, 5]))
[4] 
```
